# JS Game

## Description

This repository will be use to implement some study case for creating games (i'm using it too for studying other techs). 
It could be used too as a boilerplate for new projects (maybe i will create a template boilerplate after the setup is completed).

## Techs

- Docker
- Babel
- Webpack
- HTML/CSS/JS

## Dev

To start the project (without docker):

```code
yarn
yarn dev
```

With docker, you can use, `docker` or `docker-compose`

```code
docker run -p 8080:8080 {IMAGE_NAME}
```

or

```code
docker-compose up
```

## Build

```code
yarn build
```
